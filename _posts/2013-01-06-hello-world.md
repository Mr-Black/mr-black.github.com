The Five W's
============
***
Who?
----
Yo, dawg. I am Michael Barnes. I am a computer science major at Virginia Tech, and I decided to write a blog.

What?
-----
That's a really good question. I am sure this blog will consist of content from my various interests which range from computer programming to food to music to... really whatever catches my eye. I'd love to tell you more, but I haven't gotten that far yet.

Where?
------
Anywhere. That's the point of the internet right? I'm writing this so that I can give and get opinions from around the world on a variety of topics.

When?
-----
Infrequently. I would be impressed if I posted once every other week. I would like to post weekly, but school and work demand quite a bit of my time. I will do my best to post bi-weekly at the least though.

Why?
----
I like to give my opinions about things. I think that I have good things to say and that people will benefit from hearing them. I acknowledge that my experience is limited, and I think giving and receiving feedback through an online medium (e.g. a blog) will be extremely beneficial to me. I look forward to discussing my life and experiences on this website.
